# Node Pools Configuration - DEPRECATED
# This file is kept for reference only. Node pools are now statically defined in main.tf
# Services should use node selectors and tolerations to target specific node types.

# Available node types:
# - general-restricted: For Kubernetes system components (1-2 nodes)
# - general-public: For standard application workloads like user-service (1 node)
# - memory: For memory-intensive workloads (0-5 nodes, scales from zero)
# - storage: For storage-intensive workloads with NVMe (0-3 nodes, scales from zero)
# - spot: For batch/non-critical workloads (0-10 nodes, scales from zero)
# - ai: For GPU workloads (0-2 nodes, scales from zero)

# Example node selector for services:
# nodeSelector:
#   node-type: general-public
#
# For specialized node types, also add tolerations:
# tolerations:
# - key: node-type
#   operator: Equal
#   value: memory
#   effect: NoSchedule
