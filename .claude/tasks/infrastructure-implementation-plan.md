# Infrastructure Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for implementing the entire Infrastructure as Code (IaC) platform described in the README. The platform is a multi-tenant, scalable Kubernetes platform on Vultr with GitOps principles, supporting dynamic and static environment deployment methods.

## Architecture Overview

### Shared vs Dedicated Architecture Model

- **Platform Cluster**: Hosts shared services for dev/sue environments
  - Shared Elasticsearch cluster (1-node) for ALL dev/sue environment logging
  - Shared Kong API Gateway for ALL dev/sue environments
  - Shared OPAL/Cedar with Geldata for ALL dev/sue authorization
  - Shared Grafana/Prometheus monitoring stack
  - JFrog Artifactory, Infisical secrets, MinIO S3 storage
  - GitLab CI runners, Authentik authentication

- **Application Clusters**: Dynamically created based on deployment claims
  - **dev**: Development environments using shared services (no expiration)
  - **sue**: System Under Evaluation environments using shared services (24-hour expiration)
  - **stage**: Pre-production with dedicated Elasticsearch/Kong/OPAL/Monitoring + Cloudflare WAF (no expiration)
  - **prod**: Production with dedicated Elasticsearch/Kong/OPAL/Monitoring + Cloudflare WAF (no expiration)

### Environment Service Architecture

- **Shared Services (Platform Cluster)**:
  - Coverage: ALL dev and sue environments
  - Components: Elasticsearch, Kong, OPAL/Cedar, Grafana/Prometheus
  - DNS: Cloudflare managed, no WAF protection
  - Cost: Optimized through resource sharing

- **Dedicated Services (Per Stage/Prod Cluster)**:
  - Coverage: Individual stage or prod environment only
  - Components: Dedicated Elasticsearch, Kong, OPAL/Cedar, Grafana/Prometheus
  - DNS: Cloudflare managed with full WAF protection
  - Security: Complete isolation per environment

- **Node Pool Types**: general-restricted, general-public, memory, storage, spot, ai
- **Deployment Methods**: Platform Service (dynamic) and Git Repository (static)
- **WAF Strategy**: Cloudflare WAF ONLY for stage/prod, basic protection for dev/sue
- **DNS Strategy**: Universal Cloudflare DNS management via Ansible automation

# Phase 1: Foundation Infrastructure (Priority: Critical)

## Backend Architecture Considerations for Phase 1-13

### Critical Backend Architecture Questions

**QUESTION FOR USER:** What is the preferred database architecture for the platform service? Should we:
- Use the existing Geldata/EdgeDB for everything?
- Use PostgreSQL for transactional data and Elasticsearch for search?
- Use a polyglot persistence approach with different databases for different concerns?

**QUESTION FOR USER:** How should we handle database migrations and schema evolution across environments?

**QUESTION FOR USER:** Should the platform service be designed as:
- A monolithic service with multiple modules?
- Microservices with separate services for environment management, user management, etc.?
- A modular monolith with clear domain boundaries?

**QUESTION FOR USER:** What should be the caching strategy for the platform service?
- Redis for session and API response caching?
- In-memory caching for frequently accessed data?
- CDN integration for static assets?

**QUESTION FOR USER:** Should we implement event sourcing for audit trails and state reconstruction?

**QUESTION FOR USER:** What should be the disaster recovery and backup strategy for each data store?
